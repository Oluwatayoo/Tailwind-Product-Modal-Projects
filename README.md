# Tailwind Product Modals

This repository contains **4 different pricing grid projects** that i developed while practicing **Tailwind CSS**

The projects were inspired by a tutorial from **Brad Traversy**, and i built mine from scratch using **Figma designs** to improve my design-to-code workflow and Tailwind skills.
